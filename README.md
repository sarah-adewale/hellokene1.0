## Tech Used: 

## Client: FIGMA, EJS, TailwindCSS, Javascript

**FIGMA:**
#### Why was this tool chosen?

Figma was used to design the logo, site maps/user stories, wireframes and prototyping. 

**JAVASCRIPT:**
#### Why was this stack chosen?
Pure javascript was used to build out the interactions. Functional programming was used throughout the codebase. 

**EJS:**
#### Why was this stack chosen?
I used EJS for my view. I wanted a chance to use a new tool that looked kinda similar to html and javascript. EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. 

**CSS:**
#### Why was this stack chosen?
Flexible Box Layout Module was used for styling. It makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning. I absolutely enjoyed using tailwind but CSS is still the OG of styling. 

**TAILWIND:**
#### Why was this stack chosen?
Tailwind is a "utility-first CSS framework" which provides several of these opinionated, single-purpose utility classes that you can use directly inside your markup to design an element. Tailwind is simply a fast and easy way to create your designs

## Server: Node, Express

#### Why was this stack chosen?
I used the MVC (Model, View, Controller) Architecture for my backend. MVC is an architectural design pattern used in web development. MVC was used for  structure and separation of concerns. 

Node is a pretty lightweight server choice and can be spun up fairly easily. I needed a backend that could send a different response based on the result of another controller. 

By using Express' built in middleware architecture i could cleanly write fallbacks.
